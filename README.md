Description
===========

This application is intended to be used as an aid during the GOSTA work fair
to help the students navigate the exhibition and prepare for the meetings with
the exhibitors.

User Manual
===========

There are two menus for navigating through the application. One bottom
navigation menu for the most commonly used pages; the list of exhibitors, the
map of the exhibiton hall, the schedule and the extended menu. In the extended
menu there are some additional menu options such as navigation to the sponsors
page and the QR-reader.

Upon opening the application the list of exhibitors is displayed, click on a
company's name to display more information about them. When the list of
companies is displayed shaking the phone will produce a popup window with a
randomly selected company.

To reach the map of the exhibition hall click the location pin icon in the
bottom navigation menu. To zoom in and out make pinch gestures on the screen
and drag the image around using one finger. Click on a showcase to see which
company is located there.

The calendar icon in the bottom navigation menu represents the page holding the
schedule for the fair. A list of events is displayed and clicking an event
initiates a popup window with more information about the event.

Clicking the forth and last icon of the bottom navigation menu displays the
menu page, which can also be used to reach the previously mentioned pages. And
additional pages such as; a page displaying information about which companies
that are sponsoring the fair and a QR-reader for scanning QR-codes.
